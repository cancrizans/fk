		Flesh Kernel features several fictional languages (conlangs), because I am a huge nerd. These are absolutely not essential for reading the comic but they might enrich the experience if you are into this kind of thing.

		<div class="clongdesc">
			The language of the Reticulan Grey overlords is the <em>lingua franca</em> of planet Earth. Most of the characters of Flesh Kernel speak this language almost exclusively. It seemed reasonable therefore to represent it with English. So there is no conlang here.

		</div>

		<div class="clongdesc">
			The language of the Squid People. It's a tonal (musical) language with a consonantal root system, object-subject-verb order, deep ergativity, and confusing honorifics. Notable for lacking a standard second person. Sounds like Japanese + Sanskrit. It has its own writing system (an abjad) which you can often see in comic.

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="clongdesc">
			The extinct secret language of Humans in early colonial Earth. It's based around the idea of being as confusing as possible for Greys but relatively easy to learn, and to help resist mind control by creating deceiving patterns of thought - "Nngba" itself means "secret". It's a highly isolating language, with cryptographic argument marking, obtuse derivational patterns ("doctor" is "sickness hand"), the ability to weave words together kinda li-this-ke, and more. Its sound is unique, but roughly it's Aboriginal Australian + Igbo + ǃXóõ. It's written using an emoji-based syllabary.

		</div>

		<div class="clongdesc">
			The language of Martians (on Mars, those on Earth speak Reticulan). It's a fusional language with some agglutinative morphology. It sounds like Ancient Greek + Nahuatl. In fact, a lot of Chirasthenian is meant to sound like nonsensical strings of Greek-like bits of words. It's written using a modified Greek alphabet.

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="clongdesc">
			The language of the Qillpùtpitut, the very alien aboriginal inhabitants of the Martian North Pole. It's a polysynthetic language whose sounds are barely possible to imitate with a martianoid vocal tract. It can produce very long continuous words with the meaning of entire sentences. It sounds like Greenlandic + ... bird calls? Choking? It exists.
